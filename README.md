Hello,

I am Pablo Fern√°ndez, an engineer with a professional career of more than 15 years. I have recently changed my path towards the world of programming and management of technology companies. You are invited to take a look at my humble repository.

In this case you can see some of the exercises done during the HackABoss BootCamp I attended in Vigo, between 2021 and 2022. They are simple exercises to practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript concepts.

Regards
